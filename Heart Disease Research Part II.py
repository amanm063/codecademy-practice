"""In this project, youâ€™ll investigate some data from a sample patients who were evaluated for
heart disease at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation. The data was downloaded from the UCI
Machine Learning Repository and then cleaned for analysis. The principal investigators
responsible for data collection were:

Hungarian Institute of Cardiology. Budapest: Andras Janosi, M.D.
University Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland: William Steinbrunn, M.D.
University Hospital, Basel, Switzerland: Matthias Pfisterer, M.D.
V.A. Medical Center, Long Beach and Cleveland Clinic Foundation: Robert Detrano, M.D., Ph.D."""
